      <h2>PART TWELVE: ADDRESSING COMMON PROTESTANT QUESTIONS</h2>

      <h3>Q: "Doesn't Sola Scriptura make church tradition unnecessary?"</h3>
      <p>
        The Coptic Church affirms the supreme authority of Scripture. But consider: the Reformers themselves relied on the decisions of the early Church. Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli all affirmed the Nicene Creed, the doctrine of the Trinity, and the canon of the New Testament—all of which were defined by church councils and church fathers, many of them Alexandrian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, Scripture itself commends tradition when it is apostolic:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">2 Thessalonians 2:15</span>
        "Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">2 Timothy 2:2</span>
        "And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Paul distinguishes between the "traditions of men" (which Jesus condemns in Mark 7:8) and the apostolic tradition that he commands the Church to preserve. The Coptic Church claims to be a faithful guardian of this apostolic tradition—and the historical record, as documented in this report, supports that claim.

      </p>

      <h3>Q: "What about the Council of Chalcedon?"</h3>
      <p>
        The Coptic Church separated from the Chalcedonian churches after 451 AD—but not because it denied that Christ has two natures. The Coptic position, called Miaphysitism, holds that Christ has one united nature from two natures (divine and human)—without confusion, without mixture, and without change. This is crucially different from Monophysitism (the heresy that Christ has only one nature), with which the Coptic Church has been wrongly confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        In modern ecumenical dialogues, both sides have acknowledged that the disagreement was largely terminological rather than substantive. The Coptic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches issued joint declarations in 1989 and 1990 recognizing that they share the same Christological faith expressed in different terms.

      <h3>Q: "Why should I trust non-biblical historical sources?"</h3>
      <p>
        This is a fair question. The answer is: for the same reason you trust that the books of the New Testament were written by their traditional authors, that the early Church existed and grew, and that the doctrines you hold were taught from the beginning. Even the most committed Protestant relies on historical evidence to confirm that the Bible was accurately transmitted. The historical sources cited in this document—Eusebius, Papias, Jerome, and others—are the very sources that Protestant scholars use to establish the reliability of the New Testament itself.
      </p>

      <h3>Q: "Isn't asking saints to pray for us a form of idolatry?"</h3>
      <p>
        The Coptic Church explicitly forbids the worship of any creature, including saints and the Virgin Mary. As stated in official Coptic teaching: "The worship of Saints is expressly forbidden by the Church; however, asking for their intercessions is central in any Coptic service." This is no different from asking a living Christian to pray for you—it is a request for prayer, not an act of worship. Worship belongs to God alone.
      </p>
      <p className="protestant-note">
        Official Coptic source: Coptic Centre (copticcentre.com/the-coptic-orthodox-church/coptic-faith): "The worship of Saints is expressly forbidden by the Church; however, asking for their intercessions is central in any Coptic service."
      </p>

      <h3>Q: "Doesn't 1 Timothy 2:5 rule out saintly intercession?"</h3>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">1 Timothy 2:1, 5</span>
        "Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men… For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Read the full context. In the very same passage where Paul affirms Christ as the one Mediator (verse 5), he commands Christians to make "intercessions… for all men" (verse 1). If any form of intercessory prayer violated Christ's unique mediation, Paul would be contradicting himself in the span of four verses. The Coptic Church understands, as Paul does, that Christ is the sole Mediator of redemption—but that within the Body of Christ, members pray for one another. This distinction between mediating salvation (Christ alone) and offering intercessory prayer (all believers, living and departed) is biblical, logical, and consistent.

      <h2>CONCLUSION: AN INVITATION</h2>
      <p>
        The evidence presented in this document points to a simple but profound reality: the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is one of the oldest, most biblically rooted, and most historically documented Christian communities on earth. Its founder, Saint Mark, is a New Testament figure. Its church fathers—Athanasius, Cyril, Clement, Origen—defined the doctrines that all Christians share. Its monks preserved the Scriptures. Its patriarch first listed the books of your New Testament.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its seven sacraments are each rooted in explicit Scripture. Its Eucharistic faith is the faith of the Apostles, of Ignatius, of Justin, of Irenaeus, of Cyril—the faith of the entire Church for its first fifteen centuries. Its fasting discipline follows the pattern of Christ, the prophets, and the apostolic Church. Its practice of asking the saints for prayer is modeled on Paul's own practice and the heavenly worship described in Revelation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a call to abandon anything true. It is an invitation to discover something ancient—the faith once for all delivered to the saints (Jude 1:3), preserved in an unbroken chain from the Apostles to the present day, still worshipped, still lived, still bearing fruit.
      </p>
