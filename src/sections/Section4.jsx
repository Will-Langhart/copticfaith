      <h2>PART THREE: THE DOCTRINES YOU ALREADY BELIEVE WERE DEFENDED BY ALEXANDRIAN FATHERS</h2>
      <p>
        This is perhaps the most important section of this document for Protestant readers. The doctrines that form the bedrock of your faith were not defined in a vacuum. They were fought for, bled for, and preserved by specific men—and a striking number of those men were Coptic Alexandrian fathers.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 The Doctrine of the Trinity and the Full Divinity of Christ</h3>
      <h4>Saint Athanasius of Alexandria (296–373 AD): "The Father of Orthodoxy"</h4>
      <p>
        Every Protestant who recites the Nicene Creed owes a debt to Athanasius. As a young deacon accompanying Bishop Alexander of Alexandria to the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, Athanasius was the chief theological voice against Arius, who taught that the Son of God was a created being. Athanasius championed the term <em>homoousios</em> ("of one substance with the Father")—the word that became the hinge on which Nicene orthodoxy turns.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this stand, Athanasius was exiled five times by Roman emperors sympathetic to Arianism. The famous phrase "Athanasius against the world" (Athanasius contra mundum) captures his lonely courage. He spent a total of seventeen years in exile rather than compromise on the divinity of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why Protestants should care: <em>The doctrine that Jesus Christ is fully God</em>—not a created being, not a lesser deity, but truly God of very God—was preserved for all of Christendom by this Coptic father. Without Athanasius, the Nicene Creed might never have survived the Arian crisis. The Westminster Confession, the Augsburg Confession, the Thirty-Nine Articles, and the Baptist Faith and Message all affirm the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity that Athanasius defended.
      </p>
      <p className="protestant-note">
        Protestant confirmation: R.P.C. Hanson, The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God (T&T Clark, 1988)—the standard Protestant scholarly treatment—identifies Athanasius as the decisive figure in the Trinitarian controversy.
      </p>
      <p className="protestant-note">
        Protestant confirmation: C.S. Lewis wrote the introduction to a popular English translation of Athanasius's On the Incarnation (St. Vladimir's Seminary Press), calling it "a masterpiece" and urging every Christian to read it.
      </p>

      <h4>The Nicene Creed: Drafted in Response to an Alexandrian Crisis</h4>
      <p>
        The Council of Nicaea (325 AD) was convened specifically to address the Arian heresy—which originated in Alexandria. The resulting Creed was shaped substantially by Alexandrian theology. The Council of Constantinople (381 AD), which completed the Creed by affirming the divinity of the Holy Spirit, was presided over by Pope Timothy I of Alexandria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every Sunday, when Protestant congregations recite or affirm the Nicene Creed, they are affirming a document that was born from the Alexandrian theological tradition and shaped by Coptic church fathers.

      <h3>3.2 The Canon of the New Testament</h3>
      <p>
        Of all the contributions the Alexandrian Church has made to Christianity, this may be the most consequential for Protestant readers.
      </p>

      <h4>Athanasius's 39th Festal Letter (367 AD)</h4>
      <p>
        In his 39th Festal Letter—a pastoral letter sent to the churches under his care in Egypt—Athanasius provides the earliest known list of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament that matches exactly the canon used by Protestants today. Every book in your Bible's New Testament, and no others, appears on Athanasius's list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the significance of this fact: The Protestant principle of Sola Scriptura—Scripture alone as the supreme authority—depends on knowing which books constitute Scripture. The man who first defined that canon for the New Testament was the Coptic Pope of Alexandria. Protestants trust Athanasius to have gotten the canon right. This document asks: what does that trust imply about the tradition that produced him?

      </p>
      <p className="protestant-note">
        Protestant confirmation: F.F. Bruce, a leading evangelical scholar, writes in The Canon of Scripture that Athanasius's list "is the earliest extant exact list of the 27 books of our New Testament."
      </p>

      <h4>Origen's Earlier Canonical Work</h4>
      <p>
        Before Athanasius, Origen of Alexandria (c. 185–254 AD) produced the most extensive biblical scholarship in the ancient church, including the Hexapla—a six-column parallel edition of the Old Testament that placed the Hebrew text alongside multiple Greek translations. This was the most ambitious work of textual criticism in the ancient world and demonstrates that the Alexandrian Church took the accuracy and integrity of Scripture with extraordinary seriousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Origen also discussed canonical questions extensively, distinguishing between books universally accepted, books disputed, and books rejected. His work laid the groundwork for the canonical decisions that Athanasius would later formalize.
      </p>
      <p className="protestant-note">
        Source: Origen's canonical discussions are preserved in Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, Book 6, Chapters 25–26. For modern Protestant analysis, see Bruce Metzger, The Canon of the New Testament (Oxford University Press, 1987).

      <h3>3.3 The Doctrine of Christ's Incarnation</h3>
      <h4>Saint Cyril of Alexandria (c. 376–444 AD)</h4>
      <p>
        At the Council of Ephesus (431 AD), Cyril of Alexandria defended the doctrine that Christ's divine and human natures are truly united in one Person—against Nestorius of Constantinople, who seemed to divide Christ into two separate subjects. Cyril's insistence that Mary could properly be called Theotokos ("God-bearer" or "Mother of God") was not about elevating Mary, but about safeguarding the truth that the baby born in Bethlehem was truly God incarnate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why Protestants should care: Even the Reformers affirmed the Christological settlements of the early councils. Martin Luther himself used the title Theotokos for Mary and affirmed the Ephesian doctrine. John Calvin, in his Institutes of the Christian Religion (Book II, Chapter 14), relies extensively on the framework that Cyril established. The doctrine that Jesus Christ is one Person with two natures—fully God and fully man—was defended and clarified by an Alexandrian Coptic father.
