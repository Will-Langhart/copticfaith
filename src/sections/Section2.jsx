      <h2>PART ONE: THE BIBLICAL FOUNDATION</h2>
      <p>
        Why start here? Because the Protestant reader rightly asks: "What does the Bible say?" The Coptic Church makes remarkable claims about its origins—but those claims begin not with tradition, but with Scripture itself.
      </p>

      <h3>1.1 Saint Mark in the New Testament</h3>
      <p>
        The founder of the Coptic Church, Saint Mark, is not a shadowy figure of legend. He appears by name throughout the New Testament, with a documented relationship to Peter, Paul, and Barnabas.
      </p>

      <h4>Mark's Identity in Scripture</h4>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Acts 12:12</span>
        "He went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Mark's family home in Jerusalem served as a gathering place for the earliest believers. Church tradition universally identifies this house as the location of the Upper Room—the site of the Last Supper (Mark 14:14–15), the post-Resurrection appearances (John 20:19–26), and the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2:1–4). If this identification is correct, the founder of the Coptic Church was present at the most pivotal moments in Christian history.
      </p>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Acts 12:25</span>
        "And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry, and they also took with them John whose surname was Mark."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Acts 15:37–39</span>
        "Now Barnabas was determined to take with them John called Mark. But Paul insisted that they should not take with them the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia… So Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Mark was actively involved in apostolic missionary work from the earliest period. His journey with Barnabas to Cyprus (Acts 15:39) is the last explicit mention of Mark's travels in Acts—but it places him heading toward Egypt's direction.
      </p>

      <h4>Mark's Relationship to Peter</h4>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">1 Peter 5:13</span>
        "She who is in Babylon, elect together with you, greets you; and so does Mark my son."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Peter's use of the intimate term "my son" indicates a deep spiritual father–son relationship. This is critical for two reasons. First, it confirms the early tradition, attested by Papias (c. 60–130 AD) and recorded by Eusebius, that Mark served as Peter's interpreter and wrote his Gospel based on Peter's preaching. Second, it establishes Mark's apostolic credentials: he was not a self-appointed missionary, but one sent with the full authority of the chief Apostle.
      </p>
      <p className="protestant-note">
        William Lane, in his 1974 New International Commentary on Mark (Eerdmans), affirms: "An unbroken tradition identifies Mark the Evangelist with John Mark, and John Mark as the cousin of Barnabas."
      </p>

      <h4>Paul's Later Reconciliation with Mark</h4>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Colossians 4:10</span>
        "Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him)."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">2 Timothy 4:11</span>
        "Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Paul's final letter shows a complete restoration of Mark's reputation. The man Paul once rejected is now described as "useful for ministry." This confirms that Mark remained active in apostolic work through the 60s AD—precisely the period in which tradition places his founding of the Alexandrian church.

      <h3>1.2 Old Testament Prophecies Fulfilled in Egypt</h3>
      <p>
        The Coptic Church's claim to a special place in God's plan is not merely based on the accident of geography. The Old Testament contains striking prophecies about Egypt's future role that the New Testament explicitly presents as fulfilled.
      </p>

      <h4>The Flight to Egypt: Matthew's Testimony</h4>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Matthew 2:13–15</span>
        "An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, 'Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word.'… that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 'Out of Egypt I called My Son.'"
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Matthew's Gospel explicitly identifies the Holy Family's sojourn in Egypt as a fulfillment of Hosea 11:1. The infant Christ sanctified Egypt by His physical presence, making the land the first Gentile nation to host the Incarnate God.
      </p>

      <h4>Isaiah 19: A Prophecy About Egypt's Church</h4>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Isaiah 19:1</span>
        "Behold, the LORD rides on a swift cloud, and will come into Egypt; the idols of Egypt will totter at His presence, and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Isaiah 19:19–21</span>
        "In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border… Then the LORD will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day, and will make sacrifice and offering."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Isaiah 19:25</span>
        "Blessed is Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Consider the weight of this text. God calls Egypt "My people"—using the same covenantal language previously reserved for Israel. He prophesies an altar in the midst of Egypt and promises that the Egyptians will know the LORD. The Coptic Church understands this as a direct prophecy of the establishment of Christianity in Egypt—fulfilled first by the Holy Family's visit, then by Mark's apostolic mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        A note for careful readers: Protestant commentators have long debated whether Isaiah 19 refers to a literal or eschatological fulfillment. What is not debatable is that the passage envisions a day when Egyptians will worship the God of Israel through an altar in their midst. The Coptic Church has maintained that altar without interruption for nearly two thousand years.
      </p>
      <p className="protestant-note">
        Protestant commentator John N. Oswalt, in The New International Commentary on the Old Testament: Isaiah (Eerdmans, 1998), acknowledges that Isaiah 19:19–25 envisions genuine worship of God arising in Egypt.
