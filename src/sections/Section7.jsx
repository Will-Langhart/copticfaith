      <h2>PART SIX: FASTING — THE FORGOTTEN BIBLICAL DISCIPLINE</h2>
      <p>
        The Coptic Orthodox Church maintains one of the most rigorous fasting traditions in all of Christendom—Copts fast between 210 and 240 days per year. For many Protestant readers, this may seem excessive or even legalistic. But the biblical evidence for fasting is overwhelming, and the practice was universal in the early Church.

      <h3>6.1 Jesus Christ on Fasting</h3>
      <p>
        Jesus did not say "if you fast." He said <em>"when you fast."</em>
      </p>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Matthew 6:16–18</span>
        "Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance… But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Matthew 4:1–2</span>
        "Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Matthew 9:14–15</span>
        "Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, 'Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?' And Jesus said to them, 'Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.'"
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Mark 9:29</span>
        "And He said to them, 'This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting.'"
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Notice the force of Matthew 9:15: Jesus explicitly prophesies that His followers will fast after His ascension. This is not a suggestion—it is a prediction of what the Church will practice. The Coptic Church's Great Lent (55 days before Easter) directly commemorates Christ's own forty-day fast in the wilderness, following the pattern the Lord Himself established.

      <h3>6.2 Fasting Throughout Scripture</h3>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Joel 2:12</span>
        "Now, therefore, says the LORD, turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Acts 13:2–3</span>
        "As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, 'Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.' Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent them away."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Acts 14:23</span>
        "So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">2 Corinthians 6:4–5</span>
        "But in all things we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribulations… in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Daniel 10:2–3</span>
        "In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks. I ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The apostolic Church fasted before ordaining leaders (Acts 14:23), before making major decisions (Acts 13:2–3), and as a regular discipline of ministry (2 Corinthians 6:5; 11:27). Daniel's fast—abstaining from meat, wine, and pleasant food—is strikingly similar to the Coptic fasting tradition of abstaining from all animal products. The Coptic Church did not invent fasting; it simply never stopped doing what the Bible commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Coptic fasting calendar includes: the Great Lent (55 days), the Nativity Fast (43 days), the Apostles' Fast (variable length), the Fast of the Virgin Mary (15 days), and every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year. The Wednesday fast commemorates Christ's betrayal; the Friday fast commemorates His crucifixion. This Wednesday-Friday pattern is attested in the Didache (c. 50–100 AD), making it one of the oldest documented Christian practices outside the New Testament.
      </p>
      <p className="protestant-note">
        Source: The Didache 8:1 instructs: "Let not your fasts be with the hypocrites, for they fast on Mondays and Thursdays, but do you fast on Wednesdays and Fridays." This is the earliest extra-biblical witness to the Christian fasting schedule still observed by the Coptic Church.
