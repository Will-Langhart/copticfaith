      <h2>A NOTE TO THE PROTESTANT READER</h2>
      <p>
        This document is written with deep respect for the Protestant tradition and its commitment to the authority of Holy Scripture. Its purpose is not to attack or diminish any tradition, but to present evidence—from the Bible itself, from acknowledged Protestant historians, and from the primary sources of the early Church—that the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria preserves an unbroken continuity with the Christianity described in the New Testament.
      </p>
      <p>
        The approach here is deliberately built on ground that Protestant readers already share. Every major claim is supported by at least one of three categories of evidence: <em>(1) direct Scripture citations</em>, <em>(2) testimony from Protestant or non-Coptic scholars</em>, and <em>(3) primary historical documents</em> that any reader can verify independently. The goal is simple: to let the evidence speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will find that many doctrines you already hold dear—the Trinity, the full divinity of Christ, the canon of the New Testament—were championed, defined, and defended by the very Alexandrian church fathers who stand in the Coptic lineage. The question this document invites you to consider is: if we trust these men to have gotten the Trinity right, what else might they have faithfully preserved?
