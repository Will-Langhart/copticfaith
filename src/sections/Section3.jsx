      <h2>PART TWO: THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCE</h2>
      <p>
        Scripture establishes the biblical framework. Now we turn to the historical documentation—verified by non-Coptic scholars—that confirms the Coptic Church's claims about its founding, continuity, and faithfulness.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Eyewitness and Near-Contemporary Documentation</h3>

      <h4>Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 260–340 AD): The "Father of Church History"</h4>
      <p>
        Eusebius is the single most important historian of early Christianity. His <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> is accepted by scholars across all traditions—Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox—as the foundational source for the first three centuries of the Church. Eusebius records the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        In his Ecclesiastical History (Book 2, Chapter 16), Eusebius documents that Mark traveled to Egypt and was the first to preach the Gospel in Alexandria, founding churches there. He also records that Mark was succeeded by Anianus as bishop during the eighth year of Nero's reign (approximately 62–63 AD). In Book 2, Chapter 24, Eusebius describes how Anianus was succeeded by Abilius, establishing the beginning of the unbroken episcopal succession that continues to the present day.

      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters for Protestants: Eusebius is not a Coptic source. He was bishop of Caesarea in Palestine and wrote in Greek. His testimony is external, contemporaneous (within 250 years of the events), and accepted by Protestant historians as reliable for the basic facts of early church history. When Protestant seminaries teach about the early Church, they rely on Eusebius.
      </p>

      <h4>Papias of Hierapolis (c. 60–130 AD)</h4>
      <p>
        Papias, a second-generation Christian who knew people who had known the Apostles personally, is quoted by Eusebius as testifying that Mark was Peter's interpreter and accurately recorded Peter's teachings. This testimony places Mark in the apostolic inner circle and confirms his authority to found a church.

        Source: Papias, as quoted in Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, Book 3, Chapter 39. Also cited by Irenaeus of Lyons (Against Heresies, Book 3, Chapter 1).
      </p>

      <h4>Saint Jerome (c. 347–420 AD)</h4>
      <p>
        Jerome—a towering figure respected across traditions and especially by Protestants as a master of biblical scholarship—records in his <em>De Viris Illustribus</em> ("On Illustrious Men") that Mark founded the church in Alexandria and that the Catechetical School of Alexandria was established by Mark himself. Jerome's testimony is particularly significant because he traveled extensively, verified sources personally, and had no institutional reason to embellish Coptic claims.

      <h3>2.2 The Catechetical School of Alexandria: Christianity's First Theological Seminary</h3>
      <p>
        If the founding of the church by Mark establishes its apostolicity, the Catechetical School of Alexandria demonstrates its intellectual and theological vitality. This school—the oldest catechetical institution in Christianity—produced the men who defined the doctrines that all Christians, including Protestants, hold today.
      </p>

      <h4>The School's Documented Leadership</h4>
      <p>
        The succession of the school's heads is well documented across multiple independent sources (Eusebius, Jerome, Philip of Side). According to Jerome, the school was founded by Mark himself. The earliest known head was Pantaenus (c. 180 AD), a former Stoic philosopher who was reportedly converted by a disciple of Mark. He was succeeded by Clement of Alexandria (c. 190 AD), then by Origen (c. 203 AD), who became perhaps the most important biblical scholar in the ancient Church.
      </p>

      <h4>What Protestant Scholars Say About the Alexandrian School</h4>
      <p>
        The significance of the school is not a Coptic-only claim. Protestant church historian Philip Schaff, in his eight-volume History of the Christian Church (1858–1890)—still a standard reference in Protestant seminaries—devotes extensive attention to the Alexandrian school. Schaff describes Origen as one of the most original and prolific minds in the history of Christianity and identifies the school as the birthplace of systematic theology.

      <p className="protestant-note">
        Protestant historian J. Quasten writes in his standard reference work Patrology that the school reached its greatest importance under Origen, whom he describes as "the outstanding teacher and scholar of the early church, a man of encyclopedic learning, and one of the most original thinkers the world has ever seen."
