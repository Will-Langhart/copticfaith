      <h2>PART TEN: THE COPTIC LITURGY AS A BIBLICAL WITNESS</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most striking features of the Coptic Divine Liturgy is its saturation with Scripture. The Liturgy of Saint Basil—the most commonly used rite in the Coptic Church—has been described even by its critics as "nothing more than a biblical patchwork." The Coptic Church embraces this description: when Copts chant their liturgy, they are chanting the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three main Coptic liturgies (Saint Basil, Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, and Saint Cyril) trace their origins to the apostolic period. The core of the Liturgy of Saint Cyril is attributed to the liturgical form that Mark himself used in Greek in the first century, which was later translated into Coptic by Saint Cyril I, the 24th Pope of Alexandria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every Coptic liturgy includes: readings from the Pauline Epistles, the Catholic Epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, and the four Gospels; the recitation of the Nicene Creed of Athanasius; intercessory prayers for the Church, the patriarch, the bishops, the clergy, the congregation, the sick, travelers, the waters of the rivers, and the whole world; and the celebration of the Eucharist. The Agpeya—the Coptic prayer book of the hours—structures daily prayer around seven canonical hours, following the apostolic pattern described in Acts 3:1 and Psalm 119:164 ("Seven times a day I praise You").
      </p>
      <p>
        For a Protestant reader accustomed to thinking of "liturgy" as human invention opposed to Scripture, the Coptic liturgy presents a different picture: a worship tradition built almost entirely from biblical quotation and allusion, preserving the worship patterns of the earliest Christians in a form virtually unchanged for many centuries.

      <h2>PART ELEVEN: THE UNBROKEN CHAIN</h2>

      <h3>11.1 From Mark to the Present Day</h3>
      <p>
        The Coptic Orthodox Church maintains an unbroken succession of patriarchs from Saint Mark (1st Patriarch, c. 43–68 AD) to Pope Tawadros II (the current 118th Pope of Alexandria). This succession is documented in the History of the Patriarchs of the Coptic Church of Alexandria—a comprehensive chronicle compiled by Severus ibn al-Muqaffa, Bishop of Al-Ashmunein, in the 10th century, drawing on much earlier sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This list is not a Coptic-only claim. It is cross-referenced and substantially confirmed by external historians, including Eusebius (4th century), the Apostolic Constitutions (4th century), and later Byzantine chronicles.
      </p>

      <h3>11.2 What "Apostolic Succession" Means in Practice</h3>
      <p>
        For a Protestant reader, the term "apostolic succession" may raise objections. But consider what the Coptic Church means by it: not merely an institutional chain of ordination, but a chain of faithfulness to the teaching delivered by the Apostles. Each patriarch received the faith from his predecessor and transmitted it to his successor—the same faith, unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Coptic Church's own self-understanding, as expressed in its official documents, is that the faith delivered by Jesus Christ to His Apostles "was the same faith submitted to their holy successors who preserved it and submitted it unchanged to their children throughout all the generations of Coptic Christianity."
      </p>
      <p>
        This claim is verifiable. We have the writings of Clement of Alexandria (c. 190 AD), Origen (c. 230 AD), Athanasius (c. 340 AD), and Cyril (c. 430 AD). A reader can compare their theological positions and see the continuity of doctrine across centuries—and compare it to the Coptic Church's teaching today.
