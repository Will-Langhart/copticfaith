      <h2>PART SEVEN: THE INTERCESSION OF THE SAINTS — A BIBLICAL PRACTICE</h2>
      <p>
        Of all Coptic practices, asking for the intercession of the saints may be the one that raises the most immediate Protestant objection. Many Protestants believe this practice violates 1 Timothy 2:5: "There is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus." But the Coptic Church agrees completely with this verse. Asking a saint to pray for you is not replacing Christ as Mediator—any more than asking a living Christian friend to pray for you replaces Christ.

      <h3>7.1 The Biblical Foundation for Asking Others to Pray</h3>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">James 5:16</span>
        "Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Romans 15:30</span>
        "Now I beg you, brethren, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in prayers to God for me."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Ephesians 6:18–19</span>
        "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit… for all the saints—and for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Colossians 4:3</span>
        "Meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Paul repeatedly asks other Christians to pray for him. He does not consider this a violation of Christ's unique mediation—because asking someone to pray for you is not the same as asking someone to save you. The Coptic Church teaches the same distinction: Christ alone is the Redeemer and Savior. The saints are not mediators of salvation; they are fellow members of the Body of Christ whose prayers are powerful.

      <h3>7.2 Are the Departed Saints Alive and Aware?</h3>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Luke 20:37–38</span>
        "But even Moses showed in the burning bush passage that the dead are raised, when he called the Lord 'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all live to Him."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Matthew 17:1–3</span>
        "Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, led them up on a high mountain by themselves; and He was transfigured before them… And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Hebrews 12:1</span>
        "Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Revelation 5:8</span>
        "Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Revelation 8:3–4</span>
        "Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel's hand."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Several biblical truths emerge from these passages. First, the departed saints are alive—God is the God of the living, not the dead (Luke 20:38). Second, they are aware of earthly events—Moses and Elijah conversed with Jesus about His departure at the Transfiguration (Luke 9:30–31). Third, they are described as a "cloud of witnesses" surrounding the living Church (Hebrews 12:1). Fourth, in Revelation, the prayers of the saints are presented before God's throne as incense—and angels actively participate in conveying these prayers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Coptic Church does not worship saints—this is expressly forbidden. It asks saints to pray, exactly as Paul asked the Ephesians, the Romans, and the Colossians to pray. The only difference is that the saints in heaven have finished their race and are in the presence of God—making their prayers, as James 5:16 says, the "effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man" that "avails much."

      <h3>7.3 Old Testament Precedent: God Requesting Intercession</h3>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Job 42:7–8</span>
        "The LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite… 'My servant Job shall pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you according to your folly.'"
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote className="scripture-block">
        <span className="ref">Genesis 20:7</span>
        "Now therefore, restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In both passages, God Himself directs people to seek the intercession of a righteous man—not because God needs a middleman, but because He honors His saints and delights in their prayers. If God commanded the friends of Job and the household of Abimelech to seek a holy man's intercession while that man was alive, why would the principle change when the same holy man is in heaven—even more alive, even more righteous, even closer to God?
